## Stacks

JavaScript, React, Vite

## Learnings
In this project I learned to use ReactJs together with Vite in my projects, create components, use styled-components, and connect the backend with Axios, I used a lot of useState and useEffect to integrate the back-end with the front-end and many other tools!
